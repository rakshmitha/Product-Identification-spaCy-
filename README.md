# Product-Identification-using-spaCy

#### In this kernel, I build a custom model classifier based on NER to classify the products based on the review given as the testing sample. Here, I used reviews of the Garnier product to classify the product. The model trained continuously over 100 iterations to get an accurate result with minimum loss.
